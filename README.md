## shamelessly centralized social media

yes it's another social media platform. yes it's centralized. but with a few promises and some community trust, we think the idea can stand.

you may ask, _why is that?_ or _why would I trust a centralized platform?_ and the answer to that is simple.

**you (probably) already do.** do you use Twitter? Facebook? GitHub? LinkedIn? Discord?

if you answered yes to any of these, then you already are trusting a centralized platform that could be doing anything with your data behind your back. we aim to create something like these platforms but, as mentioned earlier, have specific explicit values and stay in-check with our users and community.

### promises

- we will keep the core platform open-source (see [license])
- nobody will ever need to pay to access core features of our hosted platform
- there will be full transparency for user data handling
- a core focus will always remain on user experience and ease-of-use.
  nobody shall ever strictly _need_ to read documentation or get a guided tour to understand the basic features of the platform.

### core features

tbd...but it'll be reasonable. **promise.**
